\section{Introduction}
In this assignment we implemented two methods to detect the DTMF frequencies. We used National Instrumentsâ€™ myRIO-1900 and LabVIEW coding environment. Both methods calculated the value of certain frequency in the input signal. This value is compared to threshold, and if the value is greater than the threshold, a correspondig LED in myRIO-1900 will light.
