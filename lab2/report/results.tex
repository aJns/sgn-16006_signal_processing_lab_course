\section{Results}
Using both correlation detection and Goertzel-algorithm we calculated the values of the frequencies in the input signal. Then, we compared these values to a threshold. If the value is greater thn this threshold, a corresponding LED will light. Using the Matlab tests we were able to pinpoint a threshold which would be able to distinguish the different frequencies. With sampling frequency of 3000HZ and period of period 333Âµs the threshold is 8 in both methods.
