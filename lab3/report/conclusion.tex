\section{Conclusions}

In conclusion the classifier was pretty good at classifying different
environments, considering how simple the implementation was. In realistic
situations nearest neighbor isn't the greatest classifier because a) it isn't
that good and b) it takes a long time. It's pretty much the slowest classifier
at classifying, because it has to go through the whole training data each time
it classifies something.

\subsection{Feedback}
The instructions were easy enough to follow. I don't know if I learned anything
super useful, as framing and nearest neighbor classifiers are pretty basic
info. It took us about 4-5 hours to done the whole assignment
