\section{Conclusions}
Comparing the images from Fig ~\ref{fig:nnInterpolation} to Fig ~\ref{fig:ppgInterpolation}, we can see that pixe grouping creates a more natural and less blocky image than NN-interpolation, with bilinear interpolation beign somewhere in between. Studying the results in table~\ref{tab:results} we can see, that while PPG interpolation has the lowest error scores of the three interpolation methods, it takes substantially more time to process the image. For contrast, NN-interpolation and bilinear interpolation are faster, but not as accurate. Therefore, processing Bayer filtered pictures using one of these methods is a tradeoff between accuracy and speed. When the amount of pictures to be processed increases, one might choose bilinear interpolation over PPG interpolation if speed is at the essence.
